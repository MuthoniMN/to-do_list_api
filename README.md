## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Node, Express, EJS, MongoDB,HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

I created this web app to keep track of user's to-do list task. 
I used Node and Express to define the routes depending on what the user does.
I used Embedded JavaScript(EJS) as my templating language so that I can add data from the database to the webpage.
I used MongoDB as my database
I used JavaScript to send requests to the server

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to deploy a web app on Cyclic and connecting the MongoDB database to Cycli7
